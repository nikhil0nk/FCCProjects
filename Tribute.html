        <h3>About Edward Jenner</h3>
        <h4>Edward Jenner (1749-1823)</h4>
          <div class="text-styling">Edward Jenner was born in Berkeley, Gloucestershire on 17th May
             1749. He was the eighth of the nine children born to the vicar of
              Berkeley, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, and his wife Sarah.</div>
        <h4>Education and medical training</h4>
          <div class="text-styling">Jenner went to school in Wotton-under-Edge and Cirencester. During
            this time he was inoculated for smallpox, which had a lifelong effect
             upon his general health. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed for
              seven years to Mr Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon of Chipping Sodbury,
               where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon
                himself.</div>
        <h4>Cowpox</h4>
          <div class="text-styling">Like any other doctor of the time, Edward Jenner carried out
             variolation to protect his patients from smallpox. However, from
              the early days of his career Edward Jenner had been intrigued by
               country-lore which said that people who caught cowpox from their
                cows could not catch smallpox. This and his own experience of
                 variolation as a boy and the risks that accompanied it led him
                  to undertake the most important research of his life.</div>
        <h4>The first vaccination</h4>
          <div class="text-styling">In May 1796 a dairymaid, Sarah Nelmes, consulted Jenner about a rash
             on her hand. He diagnosed cowpox rather than smallpox and Sarah
              confirmed that one of her cows, a Gloucester cow called Blossom,
               had recently had cowpox. Edward Jenner realised that this was his
                opportunity to test the protective properties of cowpox by
                 giving it to someone who had not yet suffered smallpox.</div>
        <h4>Jenner is honoured</h4>
          <div class="text-styling">The technique of introducing material under the skin to produce
            protection against disease became universally known as vaccination,
             a word derived from the Latin name for the cow (vacca), in Jenner's
              honour. He received the freedom of many cities, including London,
               Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin. Societies and universities around
                the world gave him honorary degrees and membership. Perhaps the
                 most significant tributes were the minting of a special medal
                 by Napoleon in 1804, the gift of a ring by the Empress
                 of Russia and a string and belt of Wampum beads and a
                 certificate of gratitude from the North American Indian
                  Chiefs. Statues to his honour were erected as far
                  afield as Tokyo and London. The latter is now in
                  Kensington Gardens, but was originally sited in
                  Trafalgar Square</div>
        <h4>The eradication of smallpox</h4>
          <div class="text-styling">In 1967 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its
            campaign to eradicate smallpox worldwide. They estimated at
            that time that there were still up to 15 million cases of
            smallpox each year. The biggest problem areas were South
            America, Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Their approach
             was to vaccinate every person in the areas at risk. Teams
             of vaccinators from all over the world journeyed to the
             remotest of communities.</div>
